This guide demonstrates how to answer complex research questions with comprehensive, evidence-based reports by combining the power of large language models (LLMs) with structured web search techniques.\n","\n","We break down the research process into clear, modular steps that can be understood, customized, and improved independently. This modularity makes advanced research capabilities accessible and adaptable to diverse research needs.\n","\n","### Together's Open Deep Research Workflow\n","\n","<img src=\"https://github.com/vinid/data/blob/master/loop.png?raw=true\">\n","\n","\n","Our Deep Research framework offers several key advantages:\n","\n","1. **Progressive Exploration**: Starting with initial queries derived from your research topic, the system intelligently explores information, identifies gaps, and refines its search strategy.\n","\n","2. **Evidence-Based Synthesis**: All findings are grounded in verified sources with proper citations, reducing the hallucinations common in pure LLM-based question and answering.\n","\n","3. **Adaptive Search with Completeness Evaluation**: The system evaluates information gaps against research goals and generates targeted follow-up queries for missing specifics. This ensures resources focus precisely on completing your research rather than collecting redundant information.\n","\n","4. **Source Filtering**: Not all information is equally valuable - our system evaluates and prioritizes the most relevant and reliable sources.\n","\n","5. **Structured Output**: Results are presented as well-organized reports with clear sections, cohesive narratives, and proper citations.\n","\n","### Cookbook Contributions\n","\n","- Set up a flexible research environment with configurable parameters\n","- Process complex topics through a multi-stage research pipeline\n","- Generate high-quality reports for the given research topic\n","\n","The functional design pattern we showcase makes each step transparent and customizable, allowing you to adapt the system to specific domains or research styles. Each function handles a specific part of the research process, from query generation to answer synthesis, with explicit inputs and outputs that can be tested and improved independently.\n","\n","Whether you're a researcher, student, analyst, or curious explorer, this cookbook provides the tools to transform your research questions into comprehensive, evidence-based reports that would normally require hours of manual work.\n","\n","Let's begin our exploration of AI-powered research!"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"peuxZFsYndwO"},"source":["## Install packages"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"c1HSzyRSndwP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744981426054,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":5335,"user":{"displayName":"IM Vintila","userId":"14563428663838584962"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["%%capture\n","!pip install tavily-python together markdown"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"S_epEg0yndwP"},"source":["## Initialize necessary functions and configuration"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"YF4SSAGV2dw0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744981429914,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1251,"user":{"displayName":"IM Vintila","userId":"14563428663838584962"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["from dataclasses import dataclass\n","from typing import Literal, Optional\n","from pydantic import BaseModel, Field\n","import json\n","import asyncio\n","from typing import List\n","from together import AsyncTogether, Together\n","from tavily import AsyncTavilyClient, TavilyClient"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_4zf_TsOndwP"},"source":["### Data Model Definitions\n","\n","Before diving into the research functionality, we need to define the data structures that will represent our research plan, search results, and source evaluation.

Initially, AI was used for traditional automation, but it has now shifted to AI-driven systems that continuously learn and improve without direct human intervention. This shift has enabled greater flexibility, continuous process improvement, and the ability to respond to variable demands [4].\n\nSeveral core AI technologies have emerged as crucial in manufacturing, including machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and digital twin technology. These technologies have been applied in various real-world manufacturing scenarios, resulting in significant benefits, such as improved efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced product quality.\n\n## Benefits of AI in Manufacturing\n\nThe benefits of AI in manufacturing are numerous. AI can help reduce operational expenses, increase productivity, and automate previously labor-intensive tasks. According to a report by ISG, manufacturers who have implemented AI in their operations have achieved significant cost savings and efficiency gains [5].\n\nFor example, Siemens employed AI-driven solutions for predictive maintenance and process optimization, reducing downtime in industrial settings and increasing productivity. Adidas used AI-driven robotics and automation technologies in its factories to streamline production, resulting in increased production efficacy and reduced waste [6].\n\n## Implementation Strategies and Best Practices\n\nTo successfully integrate AI in manufacturing operations, companies should adopt a structured approach, clear use cases, and expert support. Best practices include capturing essential knowledge, enabling workers to do more, upskilling employees in real-time, expanding and elevating job roles, and attracting new talent [7].\n\nAdditionally, manufacturers should develop a unified data framework, leverage AI agents and digital threads, foster collaboration and partnerships, invest in frontline worker development, and ensure scalability and interoperability. By adopting these strategies and best practices, manufacturers can overcome common barriers to AI adoption and successfully integrate AI into their operations.\n\n## Challenges and Barriers to AI Adoption\n\nDespite the numerous benefits of AI in manufacturing, there are several challenges and barriers to its adoption. These include data quality, availability, and bias, privacy and security concerns, IT infrastructure integration, financial justification, and in-house expertise [10].\n\nTo overcome these challenges, manufacturers should prioritize governance, transparency, and ethics, enhance data management practices, identify the right mix of solutions, craft a compelling case for investment, and find the right AI partner.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe impact of AI on the manufacturing industry has been significant, with numerous benefits, including improved efficiency, reduced costs, enhanced product quality, and increased safety. To successfully integrate AI in manufacturing operations, companies should adopt a structured approach, clear use cases, and expert support. By understanding the key applications, evolution, benefits, and challenges of AI in manufacturing, manufacturers can harness the full potential of AI to drive innovation and competitiveness in the industry.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Manufacturing AI: Top 15 tools & 13 real-life use cases ['25]. https://research.aimultiple.com/manufacturing-ai/\n\n[2] Key AI Applications In Manufacturing - Forbes. https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/04/17/key-ai-applications-in-manufacturing/\n\n[3] Adopting AI in manufacturing at speed and scale | McKinsey. https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/adopting-ai-at-speed-and-scale-the-4ir-push-to-stay-competitive\n\n[4] AI in manufacturing: transforming the industry - alten.com. https://www.alten.com/ai-in-manufacturing-transforming-the-industry/\n\n[5] AI-Powered Cost Optimization: How Smart Companies Are Slashing Expenses .... https://isg-one.com/articles/ai-powered-cost-optimization--how-smart-companies-are-slashing-expenses-and-boosting-efficiency-in-2025\n\n[6] 40 Detailed Artificial Intelligence Case Studies [2025]. https://digitaldefynd.com/IQ/artificial-intelligence-case-studies/\n\n[7] Best Practices For AI In Manufacturing: Expanding Human Potential - Forbes. https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/02/19/best-practices-for-ai-in-manufacturing-expanding-human-potential/\n\n[8] Industrial AI in action: How AI agents and digital threads will .... https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/industry/blog/manufacturing-and-mobility/manufacturing/2025/03/25/industrial-ai-in-action-how-ai-agents-and-digital-threads-will-transform-the-manufacturing-industries/\n\n[9] Five manufacturing trends being reshaped by AI - Google Cloud. https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/manufacturing/five-manufacturing-trends-being-reshaped-by-ai/\n\n[10] Top 5 AI Adoption Challenges for 2025: Overcoming Barriers to Success. https://convergetp.com/2025/03/25/top-5-ai-adoption-challenges-for-2025-overcoming-barriers-to-success/"},"metadata":{}}],"source":["from IPython.display import Markdown\n","display(Markdown(research_answer))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SpzFOqCandwU"},"source":["#### Exporting and Sharing Research Results\n","\n","The final step in our research pipeline is to format and export the results for sharing, preservation, and presentation (e.g., html, pdf, slides, etc).
